# Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) for Sign Language Recognition


This repository is a fork of the original repository available at the URL below, which is the codebase for the paper **Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition** Sijie Yan, Yuanjun Xiong and Dahua Lin, AAAI 2018.

## Installation

After checkout the project, run the following command to install and get the required libraries
```
bash setup.sh 
```


### Get pre-trained body, hand and face models
The model weights can be downloaded by running the script
```
bash tools/get_models.sh
```
The downloaded models will be stored under ```./models```.


## Training
To train a new ST-GCN model, run
```
python main.py recognition -c config/sl/train.yaml [--work_dir <work folder>]
```
The training results, including **model weights**, configurations and logging files, will be saved under the ```./work_dir``` by default or ```<work folder>``` if you appoint it.

You can modify the training parameters such as ```work_dir```, ```batch_size```, ```step```, ```base_lr``` and ```device``` in the command line or configuration files. The order of priority is:  command line > config file > default parameter. For more information, use ```main.py -h```.

Finally, custom model evaluation can be achieved by this command as we mentioned above:
```
python main.py -c config/sl/test.yaml --weights <path to model weights>
```
